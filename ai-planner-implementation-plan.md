# AI Planner Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
The AI Planner application will extract tasks from Gmail emails and process them using Hugging Face NLP models to categorize and prioritize tasks. The application will feature a React-based frontend with calendar and task list components, and will store tasks with urgency levels in a database.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Gmail Integration
- Leverage existing Gmail API integration from index.html
- Enhance to extract email content specifically for task identification
- Implement authentication and authorization flow for Gmail access

### 2. Task Extraction with Hugging Face NLP
- Use Hugging Face models (similar to script.html implementation) for:
  - Task identification from email content
  - Urgency/priority classification
  - Due date extraction
  - Task categorization

### 3. Frontend Components
- React-based UI with:
  - Calendar view for scheduled tasks
  - Task list with filtering and sorting options
  - Task detail view with editing capabilities
  - Dashboard with task statistics and insights

### 4. Database Schema
- Task table:
  - ID (primary key)
  - Title
  - Description
  - Source (email ID)
  - Due date
  - Urgency level (1-5)
  - Category
  - Status (pending, in-progress, completed)
  - Created date
  - Last modified date

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Structure
1. Initialize React project with necessary dependencies
2. Create basic component structure
3. Implement Gmail authentication flow

### Phase 2: Email Processing and Task Extraction
1. Implement email fetching from Gmail API
2. Create Hugging Face API integration for NLP processing
3. Develop task extraction and classification logic

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
1. Build calendar component
2. Develop task list and filtering functionality
3. Create task detail and editing views
4. Implement dashboard with task insights

### Phase 4: Database Integration
1. Set up database connection
2. Implement CRUD operations for tasks
3. Create data synchronization between Gmail and local database

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
1. Test end-to-end functionality
2. Optimize NLP model performance
3. Refine UI/UX based on testing
4. Implement performance optimizations

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- React.js for UI components
- React Router for navigation
- Context API or Redux for state management
- Material-UI or Chakra UI for component library

### Backend/API Integration
- Gmail API for email access
- Hugging Face API for NLP processing

### Database
- Local storage for prototype
- Option to upgrade to Firebase/MongoDB for production

### Authentication
- Google OAuth 2.0 for Gmail access

## Next Steps
1. Set up React project structure
2. Implement Gmail API integration in React
3. Create Hugging Face API service for task extraction
4. Develop basic UI components
5. Implement task storage and retrieval functionality
